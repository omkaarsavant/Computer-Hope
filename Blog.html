    <h2>My Role Model</h2>
    <p>Everyone has a role model in their life to admire and inspire them in making decision.
 Whether it can be a parent, super hero, or just someone they admire. <b>For me, my role model is 
my father who inspired me.</b> He is the one I always admire in my life. When I have children,
 I want to be similar to my father to do for my kids the way he takes care of me. 
<b>He is very knowledgeable</b>, <b>successful</b>, and he has <b>always been by my side</b> to encourage me to be 
stronger to overcome every difficulty and support any goal I tried to reach.

    <h2>My Ambitions</h2>
    <p><p>I want to be a Ethical Hacker, cerified as <b><i>C.E.H.</b></i>. <b>Hacking was a term that originated in 1990s</b>
 and is associated with the unauthorized use of computer and network resources. 
By definition, hacking is the practice of altering the features of a system, to accomplish a goal
 which is not in scope of the purpose of its creation. <b>“Hacker”</b> was a term used to denote a <b><i>skilled programmer</i></b> who had
 competency in machine code and operating systems. </p>
<p><b>This is my dream and I m going to give my 1000% to make it possible!</b></p> </p>

    <h2>My Friends</h2>
    <p><p><b>Friendship</b> is one of the greatest blessings that not everyone is lucky enough to have.
 We meet a lot of people in the journey of life but there are only a few who leave a mark on us. 
My best friend is one such person who has been able to make a positive impact on my life.
 We have been a part of each other’s lives for the longest time and our friendship is still developing.</p>
