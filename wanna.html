<center><h3><font size="5" color="white">WannaCry Malware</font></h3></center>
<p><font size="4" color="white">The WannaCry ransomware attack was a May 2017 worldwide cyberattack by the 
WannaCry ransomware cryptoworm, which targeted computers running the Microsoft Windows operating system by
 encrypting data and demanding ransom payments in the Bitcoin cryptocurrency. It propagated through EternalBlue,
 an exploit developed by the United States National Security Agency (NSA) for older Windows systems.
 EternalBlue was stolen and leaked by a group called The Shadow Brokers a few months prior to the attack.
 While Microsoft had released patches previously to close the exploit, much of WannaCry's spread was from 
organizations that had not applied these, or were using older Windows systems that were past their end-of-life.</font></p>
<p><font size="4" color="white">The attack was stopped within a few days of its discovery due to emergency patches
 released by Microsoft and the discovery of a kill switch that prevented infected computers from spreading 
WannaCry further. The attack was estimated to have affected more than 200,000 computers across 150 countries,
 with total damages ranging from hundreds of millions to billions of dollars. Security experts believed 
from preliminary evaluation of the worm that the attack originated from North Korea or agencies working for
 the country.</font></p>
<p><font size="4" color="white">In December 2017, the United States, United Kingdom and Australia
 formally asserted that North Korea was behind the attack.</font></p>
<p><font size="4" color="white">A new variant of WannaCry forced Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing
 Company (TSMC) to temporarily shut down several of its chip-fabrication factories in August 2018.
 The virus spread to 10,000 machines in TSMC's most advanced facilities.</font></p>
