Locker ransomware is a virus that infects PCs and locks the users files, 
preventing access to data and files located on the PC until a ransom or fines are paid.
 Locker demands a payment of $150 via Perfect Money or is a QIWI Visa Virtual Card number to unlock files.
This particular variant affects Windows including Windows XP, Windows Vista, Windows 7, and Windows 8.
</p>
<p>Locker ransomware is a copycat of another very nasty ransomware that has infected over 250,000 
computer systems named CryptoLocker. The name is derived from the window that opens on the infected 
device and has been dubbed the “Locker” ransomware by Lawrence Abrams of Bleeping Computer.</p>
<p>Although the Locker ransomware is simple, it can pack a devastating blow to one's computer. 
It is encrypted with AES and if you don't know the code (which nearly impossible to break) you
 can be subjected to a $300 ransom to retrieve your files. Not only is this inconvenient it is 
extortion at the technological level. Recent breakthroughs on stifling the CryptoLocker ransomware
 have been marginal at best. These minor advancements mean that there are still variants of the Locker 
ransomware floating about the web. And, many experts believe that security awareness training and ramped 
up security are the only viable options to stop the virus in its tracks.</p>
<p>
Much like the other ransomware variants, Locker will scour its victim's device in search of file 
extensions to encrypt. After encrypting the files, leaving AES encryption, Locker will then open a
 window that contains the ransom and details about the infections. Talk about a nasty bug. This window 
explains what occurred to the file system and provides payment information and demands an initial ransom of 
.1 bitcoins.</p>
