<h2>The 3 biggest ransomware attacks of the last 5 years</h2>
<p>The idea behind ransomware, a form of malicious software, is simple:
 Lock and encrypt a victim’s computer or device data, then demand a ransom to restore access.</p>
<p>In many cases, the victim must pay the cybercriminal within a set amount of time or risk losing access
 forever. And since malware attacks are often deployed by cyberthieves, paying the ransom doesn’t ensure 
access will be restored.</p>
<p>Ransomware holds your personal files hostage, keeping you from your documents, photos, and financial
 information. Those files are still on your computer, but the malware has encrypted your device, making the 
data stored on your computer or mobile device inaccessible.</p>

<p>While the idea behind ransomware may be simple, fighting back when you’re the victim of a malicious
 ransomware attack can be more complex. And if the attackers don’t give you the decryption key,
 you may be unable to regain access to your data or device.</p>
<p>Knowing the types of ransomware out there, along with some of the dos and don’ts surrounding these attacks,
 can go a long way toward helping protect yourself from becoming a victim of ransomware.</p>
