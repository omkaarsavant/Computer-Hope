<p><h2><b>How to protect yourself from viruses and malware?</b></h2>
<ol>
<b><h3><li>Keep your Software up to date</li></b></h3>
<p>Software makers like Microsoft and Oracle routinely update their software to fix bugs that could potentially
 be exploited by hackers. Oracle just released on Sunday an update to its Java software to fix a security hole 
hackers could have used to infect computers with malware.</p>
<p>The software patch came after the Department of Homeland Security sent out an advisory late last week about 
the security flaw recommending computer users disable the Java plug-in in their Web browsers.
</p>
<b><h3><li>Don’t click on links within emails</li></h3></b>
<p>A good rule of thumb is if you don’t recognize a sender of an email, don’t click on any links within it.
 Microsoft says 44.8 percent of Windows virus infections happen because the computer user clicked on something.
</p>
<b><h3><li>Use Antivirus Software</li></h3></b>
<p>You don’t have to pay for software to protect your computer or for an annual subscription to maintain the 
latest virus protection. For Windows users, Microsoft Security Essentials is free.
 Avast is another free anti-virus program.
</p>
<b><h3><li>Backup Your Computer</li></h3></b>
<p>Do you regularly back up the information on your computer? If you don’t – and 29 percent of computer users
 fall into that category – you have no protection from calamites ranging from hard drive failure to your
 house burning down. If you value your data, back it up.</p>
<p>You have three basic backup options: an external hard drive, online backup service, 
or cloud storage. Use a service like Google Drive, and your files will be continually backed up to 
the cloud. And the price is right: free for up to 5 GB of data. For more, see Online Storage Wars: 
Which Virtual Storage Is Best?</p>
<b><h3><li>Use a Strong Password</li></h3></b>
<p>A strong password is one that is complex, with a mix of letters, numbers, and symbols. While some people 
use the same password for everything, try to avoid that practice.</p>
<p>Password security company SplashData.com says the three most common passwords are password,
 123456, and 12345678. The company recommends avoiding using the same user name/password combination for 
multiple online site logins.</p>
<p>When creating a password, use eight characters or more and, to make them easier to remember, try using
 short phrases separated by spaces or underscore marks – such as “car_park_city?”</p>

<b><h3><li>Minimize Downloads</li></h3></b>
<p>Make sure your Web browser’s security settings are high enough to detect unauthorized downloads.
 For Internet Explorer, the medium security setting is the minimum level to use.</p>
<b><h3><li>Use a pop-up blocker</li></h3></b>
<p>Web browsers have the ability to stop pop-up windows and allow you to set the security for accepting pop-ups.
 The federal OnGuardOnline site recommends never clicking on links within pop-up screens.</p>
