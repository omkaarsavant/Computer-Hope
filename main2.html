    <h2>The 3 biggest ransomware attacks of the last 5 years</h2>
    <p><b><u>Malware</u></b> that holds data for ransom has been around for years. 
In 1991, a biologist spread <b><i>PC Cyborg</i></b>, the first ever ransomware, by sending <b><i>floppy disks</i></b> 
via surface mail to other AIDS researchers, for instance.In the early '10s, a series of "police" 
ransomware packages appeared, so called because they purported to be warnings from
 law enforcement about the victims' <b>illicit activities</b> and demanded payment of "fines",
 they began to exploit the new generation of anonymous payment services to better harvest
 payments without getting caught.</p>

<p>In the late '10s, a new ransomware trend emerged: the use of <i>cryptocurrencies</i> as the ransom payment
 method of choice by cybercriminals. The appeal to the extortionists is obvious, as <b>cryptocurrencies</b> are
 specifically designed to provide an untraceable, anonymous payment method. Most ransomware gangs demanded 
payment in <u><b>Bitcoin</b>, the most high-profile cryptocurrency</u>, although some began shifting their demands to other 
currencies as bitcoin's popularity made its value more volatile.</p>
<p>Over the years, ransomware has grown from a curiosity and an annoyance to a major crisis deeply entwined 
with top-secret spy agencies and international intrigue. And the biggest ransomware attacks of the past
 half-decade together do a good job of telling the story of ransomware as it's evolved.</p>

<p>We should all know the rules of how to protect our privacy and Internet security and keep Windows secure:
 Don't tap questionable links or download apps from shady sites, don't open unexpected messages and emails,
 don't give out personal information, use secure passwords, and keep your Windows software up to date.</p>
<p>You can also take a few extra Internet security steps to make sure you're safe online with a PC: Use
 a password manager to keep track of login credentials, a VPN to protect your internet traffic, and an 
end-to-end encrypted messaging app to keep people from spying on your communications.</p>

<h2><li>WannaCry:</li></h2>
<p>In <b>mid-2017</b>, two major and intertwined ransomware attacks spread like wildfire across the globe, 
shutting down hospitals in Ukraine and radio stations in California, and that was when ransomware became
 an existential threat.
</p>
<p>The first of the two major attacks was called <b><u>WannaCry</u></b>, and "was easily the worst ransomware attack in
 history," says Avast's Penn. "<u>On <b><i>May 12th</i></b>, the ransomware started taking hold in Europe.</u> 
Just four days later, <u><b>Avast had detected more than 250,000 detections in 116 countries."</b></u>

<h2><li>SimpleLocker:</li></h2>
<p>As more and more valuable files migrate to mobile devices, so too are the ransomware scammers. <b>Android</b> was
 the platform of choice to attack, and <b><u>in late 2015 and early 2016</b></u>, ransomware Android infections spiked almost 
fourfold.<b><u>SimpleLocker</b> was also the first known ransomware that delivered its malicious payload via a trojan downloader</u>,
 which made it more difficult for security measures to catch up to.</p>
<p>Now the good news: while the SimpleLocker era saw a big rise in Android malware infections, the numbers overall
 are still relatively low — about <b>150,000</b> as of <i>late 2016</i>, which is a vanishingly small percentage of Android users.</p>

<h2><li>TeslaCrypt:</li></h2>
<p>
 Originally claiming to be one of those <b><u>CryptoLocker variants</b></u>, this ransomware soon had a new name — <b>TeslaCrypt</b> — 
and a <i>clever M.O.</i>: it targeted ancillary files associated with video games — saved games, maps, downloadable content,
 and the like.By 2016, TeslaCrypt made up <u>48 percent of ransomware attacks.</u> 
<p>By early 2016, it was essentially impossible to restore files without help from the malware's creators.
 But then, shockingly, <u>in May 2016 TeslaCrypt's creators announced that they were done with their sinister 
activities and offering the <b>master decryption key</b> to the world.</u></p>
